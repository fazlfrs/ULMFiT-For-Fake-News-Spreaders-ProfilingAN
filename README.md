Code for ULMFiT For Fake News Spreaders Profiling paper


# Abstract 
21st century is named as the age of information technologies. Social applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. have become a quick and huge media for spreading news over the internet. At the same time, the ability for the wide spread of news that is of low quality with intentionally false information is creating havocs causing damage to the extent of losing lives in the society.  Such news is termed as fake news and detecting the fake news spreader is drawing more attention these days as fake news can manipulate communitiesâ€™ minds and also social trust. Until date, many studies have been done in this area and most of them are based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. In this paper, we have proposed a Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning model based on Transfer Learning to detect potential fake news spreaders on Twitter. The proposed model collects wiki text data to train the Language Model to capture general features of the language and this knowledge is transferred to build a classifier using fake news spreaders dataset provided by PAN 2020 to identify the fake news spreader. The results obtained on PAN 2020 fake news dataset are encouraging.
